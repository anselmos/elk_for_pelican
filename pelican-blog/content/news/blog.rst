Pelican now has a blog of its own!

:date: 2012-07-23

Since Alexis started working on the project almost two years ago, a bunch of
happy hackers have joined the effort to make Pelican an even better tool. Among
these contributors are `Kyle <http://kylefuller.co.uk/>`_, `Justin
<http://hackercodex.com/>`_, and `tBunnyMan <http://bunnyman.info/>`_, all of 
whom have done an amazing job recently.

We thought having a project blog would be a good way to keep users and
developers updated on the status of Pelican's development.

We have version 3.0 coming soon with *a lot* of niceties that will
hopefully be ready by the end of the week. Kyle is working on Py3k support for
integration after 3.0, and we are getting rid of old things that don't make
sense anymore for 3.0, so expect some changes.  :)
