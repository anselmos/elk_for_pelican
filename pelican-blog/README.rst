The Pelican Blog
################

This is the Pelican project's weblog. You can add content to it by forking it
or pushing directly to the Pelican blog's server.

The Makefile has a rule to do that for you if you have access to the blog's
server. When you're ready to publish, you just have to type::

    make upload

... which will generate the content locally and upload it on the server.  :)
